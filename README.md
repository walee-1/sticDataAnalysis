This is the readme file for the STiC Analysis programs. 
Created on August 4th, 2017

This is a combined effort from me and Reymond Bayerlein to analyze data from a SiPM, look for coincidences and draw them appropriately using a 3D histogram in Root.
The scripts are based on the STiC ASIC chip data analysis script from the group at University of Heidelberg who made the STiC chip.
